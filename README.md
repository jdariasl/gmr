Gaussian Mixture Regression

This is a MatLab implementation of a regression algorithm based on a Gaussian Mixture Model. GMR uses an EM algorithm to estimate a joing GMM among the input and output variables. 
For prediction it uses a weighted conditional Gaussian distribution based on the trained GMM model. It can be used for one or multiple outputs.
